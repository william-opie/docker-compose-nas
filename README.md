# Docker Compose NAS
This is a fork; see the original [docker-compose-nas project repo here](https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/docker-compose-nas). 

Most of the README content comes from the original repo; I have made some edits to account for the changes I have made in this fork.

This is a simple Docker compose project used to create a media server on your home network.

This fork differs from the original in that it uses Caddy as a reverse proxy (instead of Traefik),
and Pihole is installed by default (instead of Adguard, which is an optional add-on in the original project).

Requirements: Any Docker-capable recent Linux distro with Docker Engine and Docker Compose V2.

## Quick Start

Copy the .env template file using `cp .env.example .env`, and set the variable values.
Next, run `sudo bash pihole-setup.sh` to complete the [Pihole setup commands](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-on-ubuntu-or-fedora).
Then, run `sudo docker compose up -d`.

(Note: By default, Docker is only accessible with root privileges. If you want to [use Docker as a regular user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/), you need to add your user to the 'docker' group.)

After running docker compose up for the first time, run `./update-config.sh` to update the applications base URLs and set the API keys in `.env`. This will also set the domain, LAN IP and TAILSCALE IP in etc-pihole/custom.list (setting your local DNS records in Pihole).

If you want to see Jellyfin information on the homepage widget, create an API key in Jellyfin's Settings and enter the value for `JELLYFIN_API_KEY`.
If you want to see Pihole information on the homepage widget, retrieve the Pihole API key from the admin dashboard and enter the value for `PIHOLE_API_KEY`.

## PIA WireGuard VPN

I chose PIA since it supports WireGuard and [port forwarding](https://github.com/thrnz/docker-wireguard-pia/issues/26#issuecomment-868165281),
but you could use other providers:

- OpenVPN: [linuxserver/openvpn-as](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/openvpn-as)
- WireGuard: [linuxserver/wireguard](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/wireguard)
- NordVPN + OpenVPN: [bubuntux/nordvpn](https://hub.docker.com/r/bubuntux/nordvpn/dockerfile)
- NordVPN + WireGuard (NordLynx): [bubuntux/nordlynx](https://hub.docker.com/r/bubuntux/nordlynx)

For PIA + WireGuard, fill `.env` and fill it with your PIA credentials.

The location of the server it will connect to is set to `LOC=us_atlanta`, defaulting to Atlanta, GA (USA).

You need to fill the credentials in the `PIA_*` environment variables, 
otherwise the VPN container will exit and qBittorrent will not start.

## Sonarr, Radarr & Lidarr

### File Structure

Sonarr, Radarr, and Lidarr must be configured to support hardlinks, to allow instant moves and prevent using twice the storage
(Bittorrent downloads and final file). The trick is to use a single volume shared by the Bittorrent client and the *arrs.
Subfolders are used to separate the TV shows from the movies.

The configuration is well explained by [this guide](https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/Docker/).

In summary, the final structure of the shared volume will be as follows:

```
data
├── torrents = shared folder qBittorrent downloads
│  ├── movies = movies downloads tagged by Radarr
│  └── tv = movies downloads tagged by Sonarr
└── media = shared folder for Sonarr and Radarr files
   ├── movies = Radarr
   └── tv = Sonarr
   └── music = Lidarr
```

Go to Settings > Management.
In Sonarr, set the Root folder to `/data/media/tv`.
In Radarr, set the Root folder to `/data/media/movies`.
In Lidarr, set the Root folder to `/data/media/music`.

### Download Client

Then qBittorrent can be configured at Settings > Download Clients. Because all the networking for qBittorrent takes
place in the VPN container, the hostname for qBittorrent is the hostname of the VPN container, ie `vpn`, and the port is `8080`:

## Prowlarr

The indexers are configured through Prowlarr. They synchronize automatically to Radarr and Sonarr.

Radarr and Sonarr may then be added via Settings > Apps. The Prowlarr server is `http://prowlarr:9696/prowlarr`, the Radarr server
is `http://radarr:7878/radarr` Sonarr `http://sonarr:8989/sonarr`, and Lidarr `http://lidarr:8686/lidarr`.

Their API keys can be found in Settings > Security > API Key.

## qBittorrent

Running `update-config.sh` will set qBittorrent's password to `adminadmin`. If you wish to update the password manually,
since qBittorrent v4.6.2, a temporary password is generated on startup. Get it with `docker compose logs qbittorrent`:
```
The WebUI administrator username is: admin
The WebUI administrator password was not set. A temporary password is provided for this session: <some_password>
```

Use this password to access the UI, then go to Settings > Web UI and set your own password, 
then set it in `.env`'s `QBITTORRENT_PASSWORD` variable.

The login page can be disabled on for the local network in by enabling `Bypass authentication for clients`.

```
192.168.0.0/16
127.0.0.0/8
172.17.0.0/16
```

Set the default save path to `/data/torrents` in Settings, and restrict the network interface to WireGuard (`wg0`).

To use the VueTorrent WebUI just go to `qBittorrent`, `Options`, `Web UI`, `Use Alternative WebUI`, and enter `/vuetorrent`. Special thanks to gabe565 for the easy enablement with (https://github.com/gabe565/linuxserver-mod-vuetorrent).

## Jellyfin

To enable [hardware transcoding](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration/),
depending on your system, you may need to add the following block:

```    
devices:
  - /dev/dri/renderD128:/dev/dri/renderD128
  - /dev/dri/card0:/dev/dri/card0
```

Generally, running Docker on Linux you will want to use VA-API, but the exact mount paths may differ depending on your
hardware.

## Homepage

The homepage comes with sensible defaults; some settings can ben controlled via environment variables in `.env`.

If you to customize further, you can modify the files in `/homepage/*.yaml` according to the [documentation](https://gethomepage.dev). 
Due to how the Docker socket is configured for the Docker integration, files must be edited as root.

The files in `/homepage/tpl/*.yaml` only serve as a base to set up the homepage configuration on first run.

## Jellyseerr

Jellyseer gives you content recommendations, allows others to make requests to you, and allows logging in with Jellyfin credentials.

To setup, go to https://hostname/jellyseerr/setup, and set the URLs as follows:
- Jellyfin: http://jellyfin:8096/jellyfin
- Radarr:
  - Hostname: radarr
  - Port: 7878
  - URL Base: /radarr
- Sonarr
  - Hostname: sonarr
  - Port: 8989
  - URL Base: /sonarr

## FlareSolverr

In Prowlarr, add the FlareSolverr indexer with the URL http://flaresolverr:8191/

## Caddy and SSL Certificates

While you can use a private IP to access your server, how cool would it be for it to be accessible through a subdomain
with a valid SSL certificate?

Caddy makes this easy by using Let's Encrypt and a
[supported ACME challenge provider](https://caddy.community/t/how-to-use-dns-provider-modules-in-caddy-2/8148). For simplicity, this project uses Cloudflare.

Set the CloudFlare `.env` values, and make sure to enter your Cloudflare account email address on the base Caddyfile. (Note: You will need to rename 
the `example_Caddyfile` file to `Caddyfile` for Caddy to function properly).

### Accessing from the outside with Tailscale

If you want to access your media server when you're away from home (without opening ports or exposing your server to the internet),
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) is a great solution. Simply create a Tailnet, install the client on both the server and your other devices, 
and they will then be able to connect to one another.

After installing Tailscale on your server, update the `.env` file with your server's `TAILSCALE_IP` address.

See [here](https://tailscale.com/kb/installation) for installation instructions.

### Expose DNS Server with Tailscale

[Tailscale's documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1114/pi-hole) provides instructions for using your Pihole server when you're away from your LAN.


## Customization

You can override the configuration of a service or add new services by creating a new `docker-compose.override.yml` file,
then appending it to the `COMPOSE_FILE` environment variable: `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.override.yml`

[See official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends).

For example, use a [different VPN provider](https://github.com/bubuntux/nordvpn):

```yml
services:
  vpn:
    image: ghcr.io/bubuntux/nordvpn
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN               # Required
      - NET_RAW                 # Required
    environment:                # Review https://github.com/bubuntux/nordvpn#environment-variables
      - USER=user@email.com     # Required
      - "PASS=pas$word"         # Required
      - CONNECT=United_States
      - TECHNOLOGY=NordLynx
      - NETWORK=192.168.1.0/24  # So it can be accessed within the local network
```

### Optional: Using the VPN for *arr apps

If you want to use the VPN for Prowlarr and other *arr applications, add the following block to all the desired containers:
```yml
    network_mode: "service:vpn"
    depends_on:
      vpn:
        condition: service_healthy
```

Change the healthcheck to mark the containers as unhealthy when internet connection is not working by appending a URL
to the healthcheck, eg: `test: [ "CMD", "curl", "--fail", "http://127.0.0.1:7878/radarr/ping", "https://google.com" ]`

Then in Prowlarr, use `localhost` rather than `vpn` as the hostname, since they are on the same network.


## Use Separate Paths for Torrents and Storage

If you want to use separate paths for torrents download and long term storage, to use different disks for example,
set your `docker-compose.override.yml` to:

```yml
services:
  sonarr:
    volumes:
      - ./sonarr:/config
      - ${DATA_ROOT}/media/tv:/data/media/tv
      - ${DOWNLOAD_ROOT}/tv:/data/torrents/tv
  radarr:
    volumes:
      - ./radarr:/config
      - ${DATA_ROOT}/media/movies:/data/media/movies
      - ${DOWNLOAD_ROOT}/movies:/data/torrents/movies
```

Note you will lose the hard link ability, ie your files will be duplicated.

In Sonarr and Radarr, go to `Settings` > `Importing` > Untick `Use Hardlinks instead of Copy`
